# About Brian R. Bondy

## General Information

<img src="/static/img/family2.jpg" class="family-photo" height="250" width="375">

I consider family to be my "raison d'Ãªtre". I'm blessed with a beautiful wife and three sons: Link, Ronnie, and Asher.

In my spare time, I often run while enjoying audiobooks. My longest run took place in 2023 at Cocodona, covering a distance of just over 422 km (262 mi).

As a professional software developer, I specialize in C++, Python, Rust, Go, C#, and JavaScript. I have a keen interest in reading about new technologies, business, self-improvement, and fiction.

In 2015, I co-founded [Brave Software](https://www.brave.com) with Brendan Eich, the creator of Mozilla and JavaScript. Currently, I'm serving as the CTO and a member of the board at Brave Software.

Before Brave, I was fortunate to work at some innovative places like Khan Academy, Mozilla, and Evernote.
